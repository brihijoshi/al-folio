I am a first-year CS PhD student at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) as a part of the [NLP Group](https://cl.usc.edu/) and [INK Research Lab](https://inklab.usc.edu/index.html). My research interests lie in developing *explainable* and *label-efficient* methods for diverse NLP tasks. Find more details about it in the [research](/research/) tab!

Prior to this, I was an Analyst at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) where I worked with the Regulatory Engineering team. Even before that, I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) in December, 2020, where I completed my thesis as a part (and founding member) of the [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2)](http://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in/).

Apart from pursuing my academic interests, I am extremely passionate about upliftment of women (and other minorities) in technology. I co-lead the Delhi chapter (remotely) of [Women Who Code Delhi](https://www.womenwhocode.com/delhi), which is an organisation that works towards diversity and inclusion of women in tech. I am a huge advocate of diversity in CS Research, and always looking for opportunities to support them! I am also a musician by passion and absolutely love singing and composing music. I've tried my hands at 3 instruments (and I plan to master some, explore more). Head over to the [outreach](/outreach/) tab for more details!
